### ***<p align="center">Secure Anonymous Withdraw transaction by using onchain PASSWORD.</p>***

# ZKproof (zero knowledge proof) 
**Project**: zero knowledge anonymous transaction onchain & on a pool smart contract

- basic example for 1 target [here](https://github.com/mosi-sol/live-contracts/tree/main/episode-20)

## PRIVACY IN PUBLIC BLOCKCHAIN.

- did you know about the HASH in Blockchain?
- did you like to untrackable transaction in public blockchains?
- did you like safe & secure transaction?

#


### information
- only anonymous account if have the password can withdraw.
- the password is a hash from a string, has been created onchain.
- no need to save any file on your device.

#
### why & how to
Imagine Alice, Bob and Peter wanting to give their token anonymously to 3 other people.

Because all transactions are visible in public blockchains, the transmitter is not secure for the sender and receiver.

<br />

**The solution to this problem:**

Alice, Bob and Peter store their tokens in a smart contract (provided they send the equivalent of one token), and over time (for added security) the recipients withdraw their token.

In this case, it is not clear which receiver received the token from which sender. 

<br />

**requirement**

- pool
- tokenamize
- how to send key to the recipient
